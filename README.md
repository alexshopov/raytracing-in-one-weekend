Working through Shirley et al's Raytracing in One Weekend

https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html

## ToDo: Expanded Functionality

- Implement RIB file parser. Why RIB? Because I worked with Renderman in college and always wanted to try writing a Renderman compliant renderer.

- Convert to GPU-based renderer using CUDA.
